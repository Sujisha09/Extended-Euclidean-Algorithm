# Extended-Euclidean-Algorithm

This program implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'x' and 'n'. It also finds the modular inverse of 'x' modulo 'n' if it exists.

**Usage:**

Input Values:
When prompted, enter the values for 'x' and 'n'.

Output:
The program will output the GCD of the two numbers. If the modular inverse exists, it will be displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the inverse does not exist will be shown.
